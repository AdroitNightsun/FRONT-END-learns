    <p>Speaking out on the spat between US President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, European Union Commissioner Andrius Kubilius has criticised the Trump administration and said "that was an unacceptable way" of treating the president of a country that is fighting for its survival. 

    In an exclusive, wide-ranging conversation with NDTV on Saturday, Mr Kubilius, who is the European Commissioner for Defence Industry and Space, also said that the 21st century will be India's century and that the European Commission is keen on fast-tracking a free trade agreement with the country. </p>
